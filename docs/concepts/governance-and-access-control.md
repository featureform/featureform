# Governance and Access Control: Ensuring Compliance

Featureform Enterprise's product include governance, access controls, and audit logs. Many machine learning models, such as fraud detection and recommender systems, rely on features that are projected from personally identifiable information (PII). Consequently, establishing and enforcing robust policies supported by comprehensive audit logs become imperative for your organization to maintain compliance.

## Why Specialized Governance Matters in Machine Learning

Features originate from a DAG of transformations spanning multiple data infrastructure elements and traversing various files and tables. Attempting to manage these intricacies at the file, row, or table level can result in a convoluted web of disconnected rules. Featureform's approach simplifies this complexity by providing abstractions that seamlessly align with the data science workflow.

### Featureform's Integration with Existing Governance Tools

Featureform doesn't aim to replace your current governance and data catalog solutions. Instead, we empower data scientists and MLOps teams to work with abstractions that harmonize with their workflow, while relegating lower-level rules to data catalogs and governance tools like Collibra and Datahub.

title: "Quickstart"
description: A quick start guide for Featureform with Docker.
---

This quickstart uses the standalone containered version of Featureform. It can be used to connect to the same providers
as the Kubernetes Hosted version, but lacks the scaling capabilities.

This quickstart will walk through creating a few simple features, labels, and a training set from a fraud
detection dataset using Postgres and Redis.

### Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Docker

## Step 1: Install the Featureform CLI

```shell
pip install featureform
```

## Step 2: Start Featureform

To start Featureform, we can run:
```shell
featureform deploy docker --quickstart
```

This will pull and start the Featureform container, as well as a Postgres and Redis containers containing some
example data.

## Step 3: Set the Featureform Host

```shell
export FEATUREFORM_HOST=localhost:7878 
```

## Step 4: Apply Definitions

Featureform definitions can be stored as both a local file and URL. Multiple files can be applied at the same time.

We'll set the `--insecure` flag since we're using an unencrypted endpoint on the container.

```shell
featureform apply quickstart/definitions.py --insecure
```

## Step 5: Dashboard and Serving

The dashboard is available at [localhost](http://localhost)

In the dashboard, you should be able to see that 2 Sources, 1 Feature, 1 Label, and 1 Training Set has been created.

You can also check the status of the training set with:

```shell
featureform get training-set fraud_training quickstart --insecure
```

When the status of these resources is READY, you can serve them with:

```shell
python quickstart/serving.py
python quickstart/training.py
```

This will download and run sample serving and training scripts, which will serve a single feature value and a sample
of a training data set.

## Step 5: Teardown

To teardown the quickstart run:

```shell
featureform stop docker
```

# How Does It Work?

Now that we have everything running, we'll walk through what was done to create the training set and feature.

## Apply

If we download the definitions.py file, we can see what Featureform is doing when we run `featureform apply`.

First we register the Postgres and Redis containers as providers so Featureform is aware of them.

```python definitions.py
import featureform as ff

postgres = ff.register_postgres(
    name="postgres-quickstart",
    host="host.docker.internal",  # The docker dns name for postgres
    port="5432",
    user="postgres",
    password="password",
    database="postgres",
)

redis = ff.register_redis(
    name = "redis-quickstart",
    host="host.docker.internal", # The docker dns name for redis
    port=6379,
)
```

We can then register our sources.

The first source we'll register is our Transactions table that exists in Postgres. This is so Featureform is aware that the
Transactions table exists and can be used as a dependency.

We can then create a Transformation source off of our Transactions table. This is done using an SQL query that is
executed in Postgres and saved in a table.

```python definitions.py
transactions = postgres.register_table(
    name="transactions",
    table="transactions",  # This is the table's name in Postgres
)

@postgres.sql_transformation()
def average_user_transaction():
    return "SELECT CustomerID as user_id, avg(TransactionAmount) " \
           "as avg_transaction_amt from {{transactions.default}} GROUP BY user_id"
```

We can then register our feature, label, and training set.

The feature is registered off of the table we created with our SQL Transformation.

The label is registered off of our base Transactions table.

A Training Set can be created by joining our feature and label together.

```python definitions.py
@ff.entity
class User:
    avg_transactions = ff.Feature(
        average_user_transaction[["user_id", "avg_transaction_amt"]], # We can optional include the `timestamp_column` "timestamp" here
        type=ff.Float32,
        inference_store=redis,
    )
    fraudulent = ff.Label(
        transactions[["customerid", "isfraud"]], variant="quickstart", type=ff.Bool
    )

ff.register_training_set(
    "fraud_training",
    label=("fraudulent", "quickstart"),
    features=["avg_transactions"],
)
```

The `ff.entity` decorator will use the lowercased class name as the entity name. The class attributes `avg_transactions` and `fraudulent` will be registered as a feature and label, respectively, associated with the `user` entity. Indexing into the sources (e.g. `average_user_transaction`) with a `[["<ENTITY COLUMN>", "<FEATURE/LABEL COLUMN>"]]`, returns the required parameters to the `Feature` and `Label` registration classes.

When registering more than one variant, we can use the `Variants` registration class:

```python definitions.py
@ff.entity
class User:
    avg_transactions = ff.Variants(
        {
            "quickstart": ff.Feature(
                average_user_transaction[["user_id", "avg_transaction_amt"]],
                type=ff.Float32,
                inference_store=redis,
            ),
            "quickstart_v2": ff.Feature(
                average_user_transaction[["user_id", "avg_transaction_amt"]],
                type=ff.Float32,
                inference_store=redis,
            ),
        }
    )
    fraudulent = ff.Label(
        transactions[["customerid", "isfraud"]], variant="quickstart", type=ff.Bool
    )
```

## Serving

We can serve single features from Redis with the Serving Client. The `features()` method takes the name of the feature
and an entity that we want the value for.

```python serving.py
from featureform import Client

serving = Client(insecure=True)

user_feat = serving.features([("avg_transactions", "quickstart")], {"user": "C1214240"})
print("User Result: ")
print(user_feat)
```

## Training

We can serve a training dataset from Postgres with the Serving Client as well. This example takes the name of the
training set and returns 25 rows of the training set.

```python training.py
from featureform import Client

client = Client(insecure=True)
dataset = client.training_set("fraud_training", "quickstart")

for i, batch in enumerate(dataset):
    print(batch)
    if i > 25:
        break
```

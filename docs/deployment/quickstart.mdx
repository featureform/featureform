title: "Quickstart"
description: "A quick start guide for Featureform localmode. This is not meant for
  production, but rather for local experimentation or to test our the
  Featureform API."
---


This Quickstart will make use of Featureform's Local Mode to get you up and running quickly. Local mode requires nothing to be deployed; however, it does not currently allow you to connect to and interact with most of your external data infrastructure.

You can follow the instructions below to install Featureform locally and try out the dashboard.

You can also try local mode in this example [📔 Google Colab notebook 📔](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1P2w49GzYT5oC2U7LkjTdsIIPo8QDRRU9?usp=sharing) here.



## Step 1: Install Featureform

### Requirements

- Python 3.7+

Install the [Featureform SDK](https://pypi.org/project/featureform/) via Pip.

```shell
pip install featureform
```

## Step 2: Download test data

For this quickstart, we'll use a fraudulent transaction dataset that can be found here: [https://featureform-demo-files.s3.amazonaws.com/transactions.csv](https://featureform-demo-files.s3.amazonaws.com/transactions.csv)\
\
The data contains 9 columns, almost all of would require some feature engineering before using in a typical model.

```csv
TransactionID,CustomerID,CustomerDOB,CustLocation,CustAccountBalance,TransactionAmount (INR),Timestamp,IsFraud
T1,C5841053,10/1/94,JAMSHEDPUR,17819.05,25,2022-04-09 11:33:09,False
T2,C2142763,4/4/57,JHAJJAR,2270.69,27999,2022-03-27 01:04:21,False
T3,C4417068,26/11/96,MUMBAI,17874.44,459,2022-04-07 00:48:14,False
T4,C5342380,14/9/73,MUMBAI,866503.21,2060,2022-04-14 07:56:59,True
T5,C9031234,24/3/88,NAVI MUMBAI,6714.43,1762.5,2022-04-13 07:39:19,False
T6,C1536588,8/10/72,ITANAGAR,53609.2,676,2022-03-26 17:02:51,True
T7,C7126560,26/1/92,MUMBAI,973.46,566,2022-03-29 08:00:09,True
T8,C1220223,27/1/82,MUMBAI,95075.54,148,2022-04-12 07:01:02,True
T9,C8536061,19/4/88,GURGAON,14906.96,833,2022-04-10 20:43:10,True
```

## Step 3: Register files

We can write a config file in Python that registers our test data file.

```python definitions.py
import featureform as ff

# This is where you would typically register your infrastructure providers.
client = ff.Client(local=True)

transactions = local.register_file(
    name="transactions",
    variant="quickstart",
    description="A dataset of fraudulent transactions",
    path="transactions.csv"
)
```

Next, we'll define a Dataframe transformation on our dataset.

```python definitions.py
@local.df_transformation(variant="quickstart",
                         inputs=[("transactions", "quickstart")])
def average_user_transaction(transactions):
    """the average transaction amount for a user """
    return transactions.groupby("CustomerID")["TransactionAmount"].mean()
```

Next, we'll register a user [entity](https://docs.featureform.com/abstractions/entity) to associate with a feature and label.

```python definitions.py
@ff.entity
class User:
    avg_transactions = ff.Feature(
        average_user_transaction[["CustomerID", "TransactionAmount"]], # We can optional include the `timestamp_column` "Timestamp" here
        variant="quickstart",
        type=ff.Float32,
        # We can switch this out for an inference store like Redis in production.
        inference_store=local,
    )
    fraudulent = ff.Label(
        transactions[["CustomerID", "IsFraud"]], variant="quickstart", type=ff.Bool
    )
```

The `ff.entity` decorator will use the lowercased class name as the entity name. The class attributes `avg_transactions` and `fraudulent` will be registered as a feature and label, respectively, associated with the `user` entity. Indexing into the sources (e.g. `average_user_transaction`) with a `[["<ENTITY COLUMN>", "<FEATURE/LABEL COLUMN>"]]`, returns the required parameters to the `Feature` and `Label` registration classes.

When registering more than one variant, we can use the `Variants` registration class:

```python definitions.py
@ff.entity
class User:
    avg_transactions = ff.Variants(
        {
            "quickstart": ff.Feature(
                average_user_transaction[["CustomerID", "TransactionAmount"]],
                type=ff.Float32,
                inference_store=local,
            ),
            "quickstart_v2": ff.Feature(
                average_user_transaction[["CustomerID", "TransactionAmount"]],
                type=ff.Float32,
                inference_store=local,
            ),
        }
    )
    fraudulent = ff.Label(
        transactions[["CustomerID", "IsFraud"]], variant="quickstart", type=ff.Bool
    )
```

Finally, we'll join together the feature and label into a [training set](https://docs.featureform.com/abstractions/training-set).

```python definitions.py
ff.register_training_set(
    "fraud_training", "quickstart",
    label=("fraudulent", "quickstart"),
    features=[("avg_transactions", "quickstart")],
)
```

Now that our definitions are complete, we can apply it to our Featureform instance.

```shell
featureform apply definitions.py --local
```

## Step 4: Serve features for training and inference

Once we have our training set and features registered, we can train our model.

```python
import featureform as ff

client = ff.Client(local=True)
train = client.training_set("fraud_training", "quickstart").dataframe()
```

We can serve features in production once we deploy our trained model as well.

```python
import featureform as ff

client = ff.Client(local=True)
fpf = client.features([("avg_transactions", "quickstart")], {"user": "C1010012"})
# Run features through model
```
